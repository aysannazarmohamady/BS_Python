### 1. Introduction to Web Scraping

#### What is web scraping?
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using software tools.

#### Use cases for web scraping
- Price monitoring and comparison
- Research and data analysis
- Job listing aggregation
- Content aggregation (news, articles, etc.)
- Lead generation and contact information extraction

#### Legal and ethical considerations

- Give attribution and credit to the original source if required

  
### 2. Installing and Setting Up

- Installing Python
Install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

- Installing Beautiful Soup
```
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install beautifulsoup4
```

- Installing other required libraries
```
!{sys.executable} -m pip install requests
!{sys.executable} -m pip install lxml
```
*This notebook guides you through installing Python, Beautiful Soup, and other required libraries (requests and lxml) on your system.*


### 3.  Beautiful Soup Basics

```
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Fetching a webpage
url = "https://pythonprogramming.net/parsememcparseface/"
response = requests.get(url)
html_content = response.content

# Parsing the HTML
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")

# Navigating the parsed tree
print(soup.title)
# <title>Python Programming Tutorials</title>

print(soup.body.h1)


# Finding elements by tag
print(soup.find("h1"))


# Finding elements by attributes
print(soup.find("a", href="https://pythonprogramming.net/parsememcparseface/"))
# <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/parsememcparseface/">More information...</a>
```


### 4. Extracting Data

```
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Fetching a webpage
url = "https://pythonprogramming.net/parsememcparseface/"
response = requests.get(url)
html_content = response.content

# Parsing the HTML
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")

# Extracting text content
print(soup.body.p.text)
# This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents.

# Extracting attributes
link = soup.find("a")
print(link["href"])


# Dealing with nested structures
for li in soup.ul.find_all("li"):
    print(li.text)
# List item 1
# List item 2
# List item 3
```
